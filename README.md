# Magic-8-Ball
Requires JavaFX
The 8 Ball 3d objects were created using Microsoft 3d Builder, then viewed in 3d Viewer.
	
Each object was then viewed in 3d Viewer, and a bobbing animation was displayed.
	
Since the Viewer is not able to export any movable animations compatible with JavaFx, I used software named ScreenToGif
	to finish the process..
